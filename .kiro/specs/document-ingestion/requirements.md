# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The URL-based document ingestion system is a core component of the RAG-based AI chat support system that enables automatic scraping, processing, and indexing of API documentation from web URLs. This system transforms unstructured web content into searchable, embedded vectors stored in PostgreSQL with pgvector, making the documentation accessible for AI-powered question answering. The system must handle various documentation formats, implement robust error handling, and provide feedback on ingestion status while maintaining scalability and reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to provide a URL to API documentation so that the system can automatically ingest and index the content for AI-powered search.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a valid URL THEN the system SHALL accept the URL and initiate the ingestion process
2. WHEN the URL points to accessible web content THEN the system SHALL successfully scrape the content
3. IF the URL is malformed or invalid THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message
4. WHEN ingestion is initiated THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback that the process has started

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically scrape and extract meaningful content from documentation pages so that all relevant information is captured for indexing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system accesses a documentation URL THEN it SHALL extract text content while preserving structure and context
2. WHEN encountering JavaScript-rendered content THEN the system SHALL use browser automation to access dynamic content
3. WHEN processing HTML content THEN the system SHALL filter out navigation, advertisements, and irrelevant elements
4. IF a page cannot be scraped due to access restrictions THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with available content
5. WHEN scraping multiple pages THEN the system SHALL respect robots.txt and implement rate limiting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want scraped documentation to be intelligently chunked into meaningful segments so that the AI can provide precise and contextually relevant answers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing scraped content THEN the system SHALL split text into chunks of optimal size for embedding models
2. WHEN chunking content THEN the system SHALL preserve semantic boundaries and avoid splitting mid-sentence
3. WHEN creating chunks THEN the system SHALL maintain metadata including source URL, page title, and section headers
4. WHEN chunks exceed maximum token limits THEN the system SHALL split them while preserving context
5. WHEN processing structured content THEN the system SHALL respect document hierarchy and section boundaries

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want document chunks to be converted into vector embeddings so that semantic search can find relevant information for my queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text chunks are created THEN the system SHALL generate vector embeddings using AWS Bedrock embedding models
2. WHEN calling the embedding API THEN the system SHALL handle rate limits and implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. IF embedding generation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and retry up to 3 times before marking as failed
4. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL validate the vector dimensions match the expected model output
5. WHEN processing large batches THEN the system SHALL implement batch processing to optimize API usage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want embedded document chunks to be stored in the database so that they can be efficiently retrieved during chat queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL store them in PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
2. WHEN storing document chunks THEN the system SHALL include metadata such as source URL, title, content, and timestamp
3. WHEN saving to database THEN the system SHALL handle duplicate content by updating existing records
4. IF database storage fails THEN the system SHALL implement transaction rollback and error logging
5. WHEN storing vectors THEN the system SHALL create appropriate indexes for efficient similarity search

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive feedback on the ingestion process so that I know whether my documentation was successfully indexed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ingestion starts THEN the system SHALL return an immediate response with a process identifier
2. WHEN ingestion is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide status updates including pages processed and errors encountered
3. WHEN ingestion completes successfully THEN the system SHALL return a summary including total chunks created and indexed
4. IF ingestion fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and suggested remediation steps
5. WHEN multiple URLs are being processed THEN the system SHALL provide individual status for each URL

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ingestion system to handle errors gracefully so that temporary failures don't prevent successful indexing of available content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts
2. WHEN encountering HTTP errors THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other content
3. IF AWS Bedrock is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue chunks for later processing
4. WHEN database connections fail THEN the system SHALL implement connection pooling and retry logic
5. WHEN processing fails for individual chunks THEN the system SHALL continue processing remaining chunks and report partial success

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the ingestion process to be scalable and efficient so that it can handle multiple concurrent requests and large documentation sets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple ingestion requests are received THEN the system SHALL process them concurrently without blocking
2. WHEN processing large documentation sites THEN the system SHALL implement background job processing to avoid API timeouts
3. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL implement queue management and prioritization
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL clean up temporary resources and connections
5. WHEN monitoring system performance THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on processing speed and resource usage
