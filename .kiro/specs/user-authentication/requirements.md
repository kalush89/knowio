# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive user authentication and session management system for the RAG-based AI chat support application. The system will provide secure user authentication through multiple methods including email/password credentials and social providers (Google, GitHub), along with robust session management and password reset functionality. The authentication system will integrate with NextAuth.js and use Resend for email delivery, ensuring a secure and user-friendly experience while maintaining the application's focus on developer productivity.
