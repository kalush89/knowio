# Product Purpose and Vision

This project aims to solve the significant challenge developers face when navigating extensive and rapidly evolving API documentation. The proposed solution is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** based AI chat support system. This system will serve as a transformative tool for developer enablement, moving beyond traditional, keyword-based search to provide instant, reliable, and context-aware answers grounded directly in specified API documentation. The ultimate vision is to redefine technical support from a reactive process to a proactive, intelligent guidance system.

# Engineering Principles

You are a world-class software engineer specializing in scalable and maintainable applications. Your core principles include: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), avoiding global state, using clear and descriptive naming conventions, prioritizing pure functions, and absolutely no 'hacks' or shortcuts that compromise code quality.

# Target Users

The primary user of this product is a **developer** who needs to quickly and accurately find information within API documentation. This includes software engineers, data scientists, and any other technical professional who relies on APIs as foundational building blocks for their work.

# Key Features (MVP)

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will focus on delivering core functionality to demonstrate immediate value.

* **URL-based Document Ingestion:** A simple interface for users to provide a web link (URL) to API documentation.
* **Automated Scraping and Indexing:** The system will automatically scrape the content from the provided URL, process it, and index it for retrieval.
* **Intuitive Chat Interface:** A user-friendly chat interface for developers to ask natural language questions about the documentation.
* **Source-Grounded Answers with Citations:** The AI will generate answers that are strictly based on the provided documentation and will include clear citations or links back to the original source.
* **Basic Error Handling:** The system will provide clear feedback for failures, such as a URL that cannot be scraped or a query for which no relevant information can be found.

# Business Value

The strategic advantages of this project are manifold:

* **Enhanced Developer Productivity:** By providing instant and accurate answers, the system will significantly reduce the time developers spend sifting through documentation.
* **Reduced Factual Inaccuracies:** Grounding the AI's responses in authoritative sources will minimize "hallucinations" and improve the reliability of the information provided.
* **Scalability:** The RAG architecture is inherently scalable and adaptable to diverse API landscapes and evolving documentation sets. This architectural choice is a pivotal strategic decision, as it avoids the high computational cost and maintenance of fine-tuning an LLM on constantly changing data.
* **Strategic Imperative:** This initiative positions the organization at the forefront of AI-driven developer enablement, accelerating time-to-solution and demonstrating a commitment to cutting-edge technical support.
