# Technology Stack

## Frontend

**Next.js (App Router):** The core framework for the user interface. It's chosen for its built-in optimizations, support for both server and client data fetching, and its suitability for building scalable, high-performance applications.
**Tailwind CSS:** For streamlined and efficient UI development.
**shadcn/ui:** A component library to accelerate UI development and maintain a consistent design language.

## Backend & API

**Next.js API Routes (or Route Handlers):** The chosen solution for the backend. It will serve as a Backend for Frontend (BFF) layer, proxying requests to AWS Bedrock and handling authentication.
**NextAuth.js (Auth.js):** A robust authentication library for Next.js. It's used for secure user authentication with support for various providers (e.g., Google OAuth) and integration with the PostgreSQL database.
**AWS SDK for JavaScript:** This is the primary library for interacting with AWS services, including Bedrock. It will be used in the Next.js API routes to invoke the embedding models and the large language models.

## Database & Vector Storage

**PostgreSQL with pgvector:** The primary database for both traditional application data and vector embeddings. It's a pragmatic choice that simplifies the architecture by unifying storage. The pgvector extension enables efficient and scalable similarity searches.
**Prisma ORM:** Provides a type-safe and developer-friendly way to interact with the PostgreSQL database, including handling the vector data type.

## AI & Retrieval

**Amazon Bedrock:** This is the central hub for the AI models. You will use it to access both the embedding model and the Large Language Model (LLM).
**Embedding Model:** A model from Bedrock (e.g., Amazon Titan Text Embedding) will be used to transform text chunks and user queries into numerical vector embeddings.
**Large Language Model (LLM):** A model from Bedrock (e.g., Anthropic Claude, Llama 2) will be used as the "Generation" component of the RAG system to synthesize answers. The selection will be based on performance, cost, and latency.
**Prompt Engineering:** Prompts will be carefully crafted to guide the LLM in synthesizing information from retrieved snippets while strictly adhering to the provided context.

## Development and Operations

**Node.js 18+:** The runtime environment for the entire application.
**pnpm/npm/yarn:** A package manager for dependency management.
**Inngest (or similar):** A queueing system will be considered for offloading long-running tasks like document ingestion to avoid serverless function timeouts on platforms like Vercel.

## Technical Considerations & Best Practices

**AWS Credentials:** The AWS SDK will use your credentials (e.g., IAM roles or environment variables) to authenticate with Bedrock. This is a critical security consideration that needs to be handled securely, especially in a production environment.
**Scalability:** The architecture is designed to be scalable. Considerations for rapid indexing and minimal query latency will be paramount for a good user experience. AWS services like Bedrock and the scalable nature of PostgreSQL will support this.
**Security:** API keys for AWS will be secured using environment variables. Input validation with libraries like Zod and rate limiting will be implemented to prevent abuse and manage costs.
**Data Ingestion:** The initial data ingestion pipeline is recognized as a long-running task. It will be implemented as an asynchronous background job to prevent API route timeouts.
**Retrieval Optimization:** Advanced retrieval techniques like hybrid search and re-ranking may be implemented to improve the relevance of retrieved information.
